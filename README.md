# 2022-1 Intelligent Robotics
	
In this Lecture, we will be learning about various topics in Robotics, that I think is important to know to become a roboticist. We will be starting off by learning about Kinematics and Dynamics of an open-loop kinematic chain such as a humanoid robot. Then, we will move on to other topics such as SLAM, path planning, and navigation methods as well as very recent learning-based methods in Robotics including visual Navigation, model learning, and perceptive manipulation. Let's have some fun in Robotics. :)
